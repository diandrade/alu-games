# Alu-Games

A project focused on teaching programming logic through **JavaScript**.

The application uses **JavaScript** elements combined with **CSS** to manipulate buttons on static web pages.

### Features:
- Analyze the HTML page code to understand its structure and plan the functionality code.
- Retrieve elements from the page using JavaScript with the functions `document.querySelector()` and `document.getElementById()`.
- Declare variables in JavaScript to store elements retrieved from the page.
- Access the list of classes an element has via the `classList` property.
- Check if an element contains a specific CSS class using the `classList.contains()` function.
- Remove a CSS class from an element via the `classList.remove()` function.
- Add a CSS class to an element via the `classList.add()` function.
- Change the text of an element via the `textContent` property.
- Declare an `if/else` conditional block to implement the functionality of changing a game's status.

The project manipulates elements through buttons to simulate a game rental, with a pre-designed visual provided.
